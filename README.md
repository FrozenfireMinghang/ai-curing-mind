## 🧠 Problem & Opportunity

Many individuals facing emotional stress, mental health challenges, or financial hardship lack accessible and affordable support.  
- Laid-off employees often experience anxiety and uncertainty about the future.  
- Those with mental illnesses struggle to find daily coping strategies and professional resources.  
- Low-income individuals cannot afford therapy, leaving their mental health needs unmet.

**Future Opportunity:**  
This project leverages AI chat technologies (such as **ChatGPT** and **Deepseek**) to create a 24/7, low-cost, empathetic companion that boosts confidence, offers coping strategies, and connects users to external resources.
