# üöÄ AI Curing Mind Website

- Problem & Opportunity: 
- Many individuals facing emotional stress, mental health challenges, or financial hardship lack accessible and affordable support. Laid-off employees often experience anxiety and uncertainty about the future. Those with mental illnesses struggle to find daily coping strategies and professional resources. Low-income individuals cannot afford therapy, leaving their mental health needs unmet. This project leverages AI chat technology (such as ChatGPT and Deepseek) to create a 24/7, low-cost, empathetic companion that boosts confidence, offers coping strategies, and connects users to external resources.

- Target Audience & User Persona: 
- The platform primarily serves laid-off employees seeking emotional support and career advice (Alex, 35), individuals managing anxiety or depression who need daily reassurance (Sam, 28), and low-income users searching for affordable mental health guidance (Maria, 45). Secondary audiences include children and elderly individuals who benefit from a simplified interface and clear, easy-to-follow support paths.
